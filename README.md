Access the transformed API securely at `https://uni-backend-bza3.onrender.com`

### Please Wait upto 15-18s if results are not coming beacuse render.com is a bit slow

## Here's my approach

### Custom Backend:

- Implemented Express.js backend.
- Acts as a mediator for external API communication.

### CORS Configuration:

- Configured CORS headers for secure cross-origin requests.

### HTTPS Conversion:

- Render automatically converted backend to HTTPS so i deployed the server on Render.com
- Enhances overall security and compliance.

### API URL Transformation:

- Provided API's http transformed to https.
- Resolved CORS issue and improved security.
